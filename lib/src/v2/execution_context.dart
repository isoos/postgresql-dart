  /// Executes a query on this context.
  ///
  /// This method sends the query described by [fmtString] to the database and returns a [Future] whose value is the returned rows from the query after the query completes.
  /// The format string may contain parameters that are provided in [substitutionValues]. Parameters are prefixed with the '@' character. Keys to replace the parameters
  /// do not include the '@' character. For example:
  ///
  ///         connection.query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = @idParam", {"idParam" : 2});
  ///
  /// The type of the value is inferred by default, but should be made more specific by adding ':type" to the parameter pattern in the format string. For example:
  ///
  ///         connection.query("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = @idParam:int4", {"idParam" : 2});
  ///
  /// Available types are listed in [PostgreSQLFormatIdentifier.typeStringToCodeMap]. Some types have multiple options. It is preferable to use the [PostgreSQLFormat.id]
  /// function to add parameters to a query string. This method inserts a parameter name and the appropriate ':type' string for a [PgDataType].
  ///
  /// If successful, the returned [Future] completes with a [List] of rows. Each is row is represented by a [List] of column values for that row that were returned by the query.
  ///
  /// By default, instances of this class will reuse queries. This allows significantly more efficient transport to and from the database. You do not have to do
  /// anything to opt in to this behavior, this connection will track the necessary information required to reuse queries without intervention. (The [fmtString] is
  /// the unique identifier to look up reuse information.) You can disable reuse by passing false for [allowReuse].
  ///
  /// [useSimpleQueryProtocol] indicates that the query will be executed using
  /// the [Simple Query Protocol][]. This is similar to runing [execute] but
  /// instead of receiving the `affectedRowCount` only, this method will return
  /// [PostgreSQLResult] which contains `affectedRowCount` in addition to any
  /// data returned by the executed statement.
  ///
  /// It's important to understand that when [useSimpleQueryProtocol] is `true`,
  /// all values will be of type [String] even if they have different type in the
  /// database. For instance, the value of an `int4` column will be returned as
  /// a [String] instead of an [int].
  ///
  /// Setting [useSimpleQueryProtocol] to `true` is mainly useful for when the
  /// connection is established using the Streaming Replication Protocol. When
  /// the connection is in replication mode, the default Extended Query Protocol
  /// cannot be used as the database will throw an error and drop the connection.
  /// In other words, only the Simple Query Protocol can be used with Streaming
  /// Replication Protocol.

  ///
  /// Each row map contains key-value pairs for every table in the query. The value is a [Map] that contains
  /// key-value pairs for each column from that table. For example, consider
  /// the following query:
  ///
  ///         SELECT employee.id, employee.name FROM employee;

  ///
  ///         [
  ///           {"employee" : {"name": "Bob", "id": 1}}
  ///         ]
  ///

  ///
  ///         SELECT employee.id, employee.name, company.name FROM employee LEFT OUTER JOIN company ON employee.company_id=company.id;
