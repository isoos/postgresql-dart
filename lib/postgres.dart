/// A description of a SQL query as interpreted by this package.

/// This includes the SQL string to send to the database and known data types
/// for parameters, if any.
///
/// Queries can be sent to postgres as-is. To do that, pass a string to
/// [Session.prepare] or [Session.execute] or use the default [Sql]
/// constructor. These queries are not intepreted or altered by this package in
/// any way. If you're using parameter in those queries, you either have to
/// specify their types in the [Sql] constructor, or exclusively use
/// [TypedValue] instances in [Session.execute], [Statement.bind] and
/// [Statement.run].
///
/// Alternatively, you can use named variables that will be desugared by this
/// package with the [Sql.named] factory. If you prefer positional variables,
/// but want to specify their types in text or use a different symbol for
/// variables (Postgres uses `$`), you can use the [Sql.indexed] constructor
/// instead.
class Sql {
  /// The default constructor, sending [sql] to the Postgres database without
  /// any modification.
  ///
  /// The [types] parameter can optionally be used to pass the types of
  /// parameters in the query. If they're not set, only [TypedValue]
  /// instances can be used when binding values later.
  factory Sql(String sql, {List<Type>? types}) = SqlImpl.direct;

  /// Looks for positional parameters in [sql] and desugars them.
  ///
  /// This mode is very similar to the native format understood by postgres,
  /// except that:
  ///  1. The character for variables is customizable (postgres will always use
  ///     `$`). To be consistent with [Sql.named], this method uses `@` as the
  ///     default character.
  ///  2. Not every variable needs to have en explicit index. When declaring a
  ///     variable without an index, the first index higher than any previously
  ///     seen index is used instead.
  ///
  /// For instance, `Sql.indexed('SELECT ?2, ?, ?1', substitution: '?')`
  /// declares three variables (appearing in the order 2, 3, 1).
  ///
  /// Just like with [Sql.named], it is possible to declare an explicit type for
  /// variables: `Sql.indexed('SELECT @1:int8')`.
  factory Sql.indexed(String sql, {String substitution}) = SqlImpl.indexed;

  /// Looks for named parameters in [sql] and desugars them.
  ///
  /// You can specify a character that starts parameters (by default, `@` is
  /// used).
  /// In those queries, `@variableName` can be used to declare a variable.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final sql = Sql.named('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @id');
  /// final stmt = await connection.prepare(sql);
  /// final vars = {'id': TypedValue(Type.integer, 3)};
  /// await for (final row in stmt.bind(vars)) {
  ///   // Got user with id 3
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// To make this more consise, you can also supply the type of the variable
  /// in the query:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final sql = Sql.named('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @id:int4');
  /// final stmt = await connection.prepare(sql);
  /// final vars = {'id': 3};
  /// await for (final row in stmt.bind(vars)) {
  ///   // Got user with id 3
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// String literals, identifiers and comments are correctly ignored. So for
  /// instance, the following query only uses one variable (`id`):
  ///
  /// ```sql
  /// SELECT name AS "@handle" FROM users WHERE id = @id; -- select @users
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Note that this syntax is a feature of this package and not directly
  /// understood by postgres. This requires the package to scan the [sql] for
  /// variables, which adds a small overhead over when compared to a direct
  /// [Sql] query.
  /// Also, the scanner might interpret queries incorrectly in the case of
  /// malformed [sql] (like an unterminated string literal or comment). In that
