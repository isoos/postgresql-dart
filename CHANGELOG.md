# Changelog

## 3.3.0

- timeZone option in ConnectionSettings is now a TimeZoneSettings type instead of String
- add more flexibility on how timestamp and timestaptz types are decoded by adding flags to the TimeZoneSettings 
- opcional decode timestamp without timezone as local DateTime and decode timestamp with timezone respecting the timezone defined in the connection

## 3.2.1

- Added or fixed decoders support for `QueryMode.simple`:
  `double`, `real`, `timestampWithTimezone`, `timestampWithoutTimezone`,
  `date`, `numeric`, `json`, `jsonb` [#338](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/338) by [pst9354](https://github.com/pst9354).

## 3.2.0

- Support for `tsvector` and `tsquery` types.
- `ResultRow.isSqlNull(int)` returns true if the column's value was SQL `NULL`.
- `TypedValue.isSqlNull` indicates SQL `NULL` (vs. JSON `null`).

## 3.1.2

- `ConnectionSettings.onOpen` callback to initialize a new connection and set
  connection-level variables.

## 3.1.1

- Use ':' (colon) for substitution and cast operator together [#309](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/309) by [xvrh](https://github.com/xvrh).

## 3.1.0

Added the following PostgreSQL builtin types:
- Geometric types `line`, `lseg`, `path`, `polygon`, `box`, `circle`
- Range types `int4range`, `int8range`, `daterange`, `tsrange`, `tstzrange`
- Time type `time`
- Array types `_int2`, `_date`, `_time`, `_timestamp`, `_timestamptz`, `_uuid`

Huge thanks for [#294](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/294) by [wolframm](https://github.com/Wolframm-Activities-OU).

## 3.0.8

- Properly react to connection losses by reporting the database connection as
  closed.

## 3.0.7

- Allow cleartext passwords when secure connection is used. ([#283](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/283) by [simolus3](https://github.com/simolus3))

## 3.0.6

- Allow passing a `SecurityContext` when opening postgres connections.

## 3.0.5

- Support for type `char`/`character`/`bpchar`.

## 3.0.4

- Fix: SSL connection problem handler.

## 3.0.3

- Using const for ConnectionSettings, SessionSettings and PoolSettings classes. ([#267](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/267) by [Gerrel](https://github.com/Gerrel))
- Parsing of `Sql.indexed` and `Sql.named` happens when the `Connection` starts
  to interpret it. Errors with unknown type names are thrown in this later step.

## 3.0.2

- Fix: Dispose disconnected pool `Connection`s. ([#260](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/260) by [nehzata](https://github.com/nehzata)).
- Deprecated `ParseMessage` constructor's `types` argument, use `typeOids` instead.
  (As most users don't access this directly, it will be removed in `3.1.0`).

## 3.0.1

- Fix: do not allow `execute` after closing the `Connection`.
- `Session.runTx()` supports rolling back the transaction through `TxSession.rollback()`
  (otherwise any exception has the same effect, but callers need to catch it).
- Supporting more type aliases, including `serial4`, `serial8`, `integer`...
- Deprecated all of v2 API, legacy fallback will be removed in next minor version (`3.1.0`).

## 3.0.0

New features:

- New API (better names and consistency).
- New SQL parsing and configurable query substitutions.
- Integrated connection pooling.
- A somewhat-compatible legacy API support to help migrations (will be removed in `3.1.0`).

### BREAKING CHANGES

The package had a partial rewrite affecting public client API and internal
behaviour, keeping most of the wire protocol handling from the old version.

**Users of this package must rewrite and test their application when upgrading.**

Notable breaking behaviour changes:

  - Simple query protocol allows sending queries to the server without
    awaiting on the result. The new implementation queues these request
    on the client instead.
  - Table name OIDs are not fetched or cached, this information from the
    result schema is absent, also causing `mappedResultsQuery` to be
    removed from the new API.
  - Queries are not cached implicitly, explicit prepared statements can be
    used instead.
  - `interval` values are returned as `Interval` type instead of `Duration`.
  - A newly added `UndecodedBytes` instances are returned when the package does
    not know or has not implemented the appropriate type decoding yet.
    Previously these values were auto-encoded to `String` and if that failed
    the `Uint8List` were used.
  - Types, fields and parameter names may have been renamed to be more
    consistent or more aligned with the Dart naming guides.

### Legacy compatibility layer

`package:postgres/legacy.dart` provides a somewhat backwards-compatible API
via the `PostgreSQLConnection.withV3()` constructor. Many features, including
the ones mentioned above are missing and/or throw `UnimplementedError` when called.

### Migration

  - You may use the legacy compatibility layer to check if your code relies on
    any of the above mentioned feature, rewrite if needed.
  - Start using the new API, incrementally, when possible.
  - For most queries, you may use `Sql.named('SELECT ...')` to keep the default
    name- and `Map`-based query `@variable`` substitution, or you may use the
    raw `$1` version (with 1-based indexes).
  - Always write tests.

If you have any issues with migration or with the new behavior, please open an
issue on the package's GitHub issue tracker or discussions.

### Thanks

The rewrite happened because of many contributions (including code, comments or
criticism) on the new direction and design. I'd like to call out especially to
[simolus3](https://github.com/simolus3) and [osaxma](https://github.com/osaxma),
who helped to push forward.

## 2.6.3

- Allow `encoding` to be specified for connections. The setting will be used for all connection-related string conversions.
- Allow generic `List` type as substitution values in binary encoding (as long as the inner type matches).
- Refactor: replaced `UTF8BackedString` with generic encoding (not complete).
- Breaking change in `package:postgres/messages.dart`: default constructors made internal, parsing is done with more efficient reader.

## 2.6.2

- Improved (experimental) v3 implementation.
  [#98](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/98) and
  [#102](https://github.com/isoos/postgresql-dart/pull/102) by [simolus3](https://github.com/simolus3).

  one in version `3.0.0` of this package.
  At the moment, the new library is experimental and not fully implemented. Until the
  actual `3.0.0` release, the new APIs might change without a breaking version.
